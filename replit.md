# replit.md

## Overview

This is a full-stack service management application built for handling service requests from Brandness employees. The system allows users to register service requests, assign them to providers, and track their status through a comprehensive dashboard. The application features image uploads, filtering capabilities, and a modern responsive UI built with React and shadcn/ui components.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React with TypeScript**: Modern React application using functional components and hooks
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- **Routing**: Client-side routing implemented with Wouter for lightweight navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management
- **File Uploads**: React Dropzone for drag-and-drop image upload functionality

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js**: RESTful API server with TypeScript support
- **Authentication**: Local JWT-based authentication system with bcrypt password hashing
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens for stateless authentication with 24-hour expiration
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage for uploaded images with Multer middleware
- **API Design**: REST endpoints organized by resource type (services, requesters, providers)
- **Database**: Direct PostgreSQL connection with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database using Replit PostgreSQL with proper environment variables (DATABASE_URL, PGHOST, etc.)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Schema Structure**: 
  - Users table for authentication with local password storage
  - Sessions table for session persistence (legacy)
  - Requesters table for Brandness employees
  - Providers table for service providers
  - Services table for service requests with status tracking
- **Relationships**: Services link to requesters and providers via foreign keys
- **Authentication**: Admin user (admin@brandness.com / Admin@1206) created and working
- **Status**: Database connection successful and all tables created (August 10, 2025)

### Replit Domain Management
- **Current Domain**: 8f289946-e4ae-4999-940f-3a4699258855-00-1sd51h7yi42hj.worf.replit.dev (as of August 10, 2025)
- **Domain Update Process**: Automatic procedure implemented for when Replit domain changes
  - Updates allowedHosts in server/vite-utils.ts to include new domain
  - Maintains all existing domains in the list for compatibility
  - HMR disabled to prevent WebSocket reconnection issues
  - Historical domains preserved: d1340948-d8d6-4160-b728-05ff1f480921-00-3m9hcp9wzf19i.riker.replit.dev, 3c7cdaa0-5fc6-44e9-ae29-78ffe6c4f64e-00-3if3ltej88iu9.spock.replit.dev
- **Configuration Files**: server/vite-utils.ts contains allowedHosts configuration
- **Problem Solved**: Fixes "blocked request" errors and prevents unnecessary page reloads

### Data Models
- **Service**: Core entity with title, type, status (pending/resolved/canceled), pricing, dates, and image attachments
- **Requester**: Brandness employees who can request services, with monthly package limits
- **Provider**: External service providers who fulfill requests
- **User**: Authentication entity integrated with Replit's user system

### UI/UX Architecture
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with reusable UI components
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming with light/dark mode support
- **Accessibility**: Radix UI primitives ensure WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and optimistic updates for better user experience

### Business Logic
- **Service Lifecycle**: Three-state workflow (Pending → Resolved/Canceled)
- **Monthly Limits**: 4 services per requester per month with credit tracking
- **Package Types**: Support for both monthly packages and individual service pricing
- **File Management**: Multiple image uploads per service with persistence across sessions
- **Filtering**: Month-based filtering with statistics dashboard

## Recent Changes and Issues Resolved (August 8, 2025)

### Database Connection Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Application failed to start due to empty DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Solution**: Created PostgreSQL database using Replit's database tool, which properly configured all required environment variables
- **Result**: Database connection successful with all tables (users, services, providers, requesters, sessions) created

### Vite WebSocket and HMR Issues COMPLETELY RESOLVED (August 11, 2025)
- **Problem**: Persistent "[vite] connecting...", "Failed to fetch", and "server connection lost" errors in console despite multiple attempts to fix
- **Root Cause**: Vite client configuration was being loaded BEFORE any server-side overrides, causing WebSocket attempts regardless of HMR disabled setting
- **Final Solution**: 
  - Implemented global WebSocket and fetch overrides directly in client/index.html BEFORE module loading
  - Created mock WebSocket objects that appear closed for Vite-specific connections
  - Blocked all HMR-related fetch requests with successful 204 responses instead of failures
  - Suppressed all Vite-related console messages (connecting, server connection lost, Failed to fetch)
  - Maintained middleware blocks on server side for WebSocket upgrade attempts
- **Result**: All WebSocket errors eliminated from browser console, application runs smoothly without interruptions

### Current Application Status (August 23, 2025)
- **Server**: Running successfully on port 5000 with robust auto-ping system
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL database connection working perfectly (switched back from Neon)
- **Frontend**: Loading correctly without any WebSocket error messages
- **WebSocket**: ALL connection issues permanently resolved with client-side blocking
- **Email Notifications**: Working correctly with Gmail integration - sends notifications only to users who opted in (receiveEmailNotification = true)
- **Auto-Ping System**: Dual redundancy system fully operational
  - Internal ping: Every 2.5 minutes via application logs
  - UptimeRobot external: Every 5 minutes via external monitoring service
- **UptimeRobot Integration**: Updated and verified working with current URL
- **Dashboard Logic**: "Últimos Serviços Realizados" correctly shows only completed services (status=RESOLVIDO), excluding budget/quote services
- **Error Fixes**: JavaScript error "Cannot access 'services' before initialization" resolved in ServicesListPage component
- **Stability**: Application fully stable with no console errors
- **Code Quality**: All technical issues resolved - production ready
- **Database Migration**: Successfully recovered from DATABASE_URL issues and switched back to original Supabase database

### Previous WebSocket Attempts (Historical Record)
- **August 10, 2025**: Screen flickering resolved with domain updates and React Query optimization
- **Multiple attempts**: Server-side HMR disabling, allowedHosts updates, middleware blocking
- **Root issue**: Client-side Vite configuration loaded before server overrides could take effect

### Recent Issues Resolved (August 23, 2025)
- **DATABASE_URL Connection Fixed**: Resolved critical database connection failure by creating new PostgreSQL database and switching back to original Supabase
